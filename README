This was quickly put together for Houston's /. 15th anniversary gathering on
2012-10-26 <http://slashdot.org/anniversary.pl?view_id=869>. I brought a
projector and displayed the titles of old /. stories on the ceiling.

Funny thing is that I didn't have any of the processing done on the files until I got to the location.

Running:

You need to run `bin/download.pl` first to download the old story index into the
`archive/` directory. Then run `bin/extract-titles` to create the title list.
Finally, start the scrolling display by running `bin/display`.

Requires (Debian package names in parentheses):
- Perl (perl)
- WWW::Mechanize (libwww-mechanize-perl)
- DateTime (libdatetime-perl)
- sed, grep, shuf (sed, grep, coreutils)
- xscreensaver's fontglide (screensaver-data-extra)

The titles.gz archive is (c) Slashdot and is provided so that you don't start
hammering their servers. :-)
